# Flying Ghost
 	This is my first Unity Game I made. It is 2D mobile game and the programing language 	used is C#. It is supposed to resemble Flappy Bird but with a unique style. I have made a character that moves in response to my input. I have spawned new objects on a timer. I have created a UI that shows the score and made that score go up when conditions are met. The game has the ability to start again. I added a function that kills the player and opens the game over screen when the player goes off-screen. I fixed the score so it doesn't go up when the player id dead. I added sound effects whenever the ghost goes through the pypes. I also added a new scene that is now my main scene from where I can start the game. Also in the future I plan to advance my game so it goes even further beyond. The things I want to add is: 	/Maybe a save the high score which I have not added yet becouse it diesnt go with the aestetics for now 	/I want to have more skins for the ghost that can be unlocked. 	/I want the backgound or the pypes to change when the player advances 	/I want to add a particle effect of other bats flying around the ghost
